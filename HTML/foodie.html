                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk: First, whisk the seasonings together in a shallow dish or small bowl. </li>
                    <li>Season: Next, pat dry with a paper towel before coating with oil and tossing it in the seasoning. Press the blackening spice so it sticks to the side of the chicken. </li>
                    <li>Sear: Then, on a hot skillet over high heat, cook on each side for about 30 seconds to sear it. </li>
                    <li>Bake: Last, transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for 12 to 15 minutes at 400 degrees F. </li>
                    <li>Serve: Finally, place chicken on a platter and cover with foil. Let it rest for five minutes before serving. </li>
